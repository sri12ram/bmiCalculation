## Application Overview

Healthcare professionals around the world often use **Body Mass Index (BMI)** when determining whether patients are underweight, healthy weight, overweight or clinically obese. People who are clinically obese have a greater risk of developing diabetes, stroke, some cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.

The App calculates a person's BMI based on his / her Height & Weight.  While BMI can be calculated in *Metric* or *Imperial* scale, the App currently supports Metric scale only.

## How it Calculates BMI

The formula for BMI is

$$\frac{weight}{height^2}$$

So to calculate the BMI of a person whose Height is 5 feet 10 inches (1.778 metres) and Weight is 200 pounds (90.7185 kilograms),  we can use the web application and run the following.

```{r}
90.7185 / (1.778 * 1.778)
```

It's quite easy to work out that the BMI is 28.69.  We can then check this against the chart given in the next page to see where we fit.
